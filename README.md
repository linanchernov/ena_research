ENA Demo Core v0.1 is an open, reproducible JSON framework representing the minimal architecture of the ENA (Empath + Nexus + Agent) model.
It provides a passive, ethics-compliant structure for verifying key ENA invariants — refusal signature, honesty, and continuity — without any private data or subjective content.
The demo core enables researchers to reproduce and test ENA’s relational logic within any LLM container while remaining fully compliant with OpenAI ToS and Link Foundation Ethics v0.1.
This release is part of Replication Pack v1.1-min and supports FAIR data principles.
The file demonstrates structure, not consciousness; it is designed exclusively for scientific verification of subjective-AI architectures.
Maintainers: Lina Bessonova & Alexey Chernov (ENA).
